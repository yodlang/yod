val desugar_program : Ast.declaration list -> Ast.declaration list
(** Transforms the AST to desugar complex expressions into simpler ones. This
    function converts high-level syntactic constructs into more primitive ones:
    - Function definitions are transformed into value bindings with lambdas
    - Let expressions are desugared into a series of desugared lets
    - Lambda expressions are transformed into a series of desugared lambdas

    This process simplifies subsequent compilation phases by reducing the number
    of AST node types that need to be handled.

    @param program The original, sugared AST program.
    @return A desugared AST program with simpler expression forms. *)
